# montecarlo_simulation_practice
Just a small simulation model of $AAPL. Timeframe = 99days

The Monte Carlo model tries to generate real scenerios made by randomness based on a previously stipulated distribution. In this way, it allows us to reach a statistically possible future.

We algo use the arithmetic Brownian motion in order to calculate the returns.  (just to make it simpler)

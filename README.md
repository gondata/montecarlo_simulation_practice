# montecarlo_simulation_practice
Just a small simulation model of $AAPL. Timeframe = 99days

The Monte Carlo model tries to generate real sceneries made by randomness based on a previously stipulated distribution, in this way, it allows us to reach a statistically possible future.

To calculate the returns we use the arithmetic Brownian motion (just to make it simpler)
